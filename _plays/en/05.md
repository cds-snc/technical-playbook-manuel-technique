title: Choose the stack carefully
---

The technology decisions we make need to enable development teams to work efficiently and enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively. Our choices for hosting infrastructure, databases, software frameworks, programming languages and the rest of the technology stack should seek to avoid vendor lock-in and match what successful modern consumer and enterprise software companies would choose today. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source, cloud-based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack, because of their widespread adoption and support by successful consumer and enterprise technology companies in the private sector. 

<h3>Skills to work on </h3>

1. Ensure the skills of the community line up with the requirements of supporting the stack in the near and long term
1. Assess the sufficient maturity with the developer tooling on the stack
1. Assess the technology stack has reasonable security management and patching in place
1. Review and rationalize additional technology dependencies
