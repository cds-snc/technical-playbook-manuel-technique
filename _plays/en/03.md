title: Deploy often
---

Frequent deployment is valuable because it allows your users to get new features more rapidly, to give more rapid feedback on those features, and generally become more collaborative in the development cycle. This helps break down the barriers between users of our services and developers - which are the biggest barriers to successful software development.

<h3>Skills to work on </h3>

1. Deploy updated code into production environments multiple times a day in a structured and safe way
1. Use infrastructure as code to manage and provision all environments
1. Use hermetic builds - meaning that they are insensitive to the libraries and other software installed on the build machine - via [container images](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) and store them in the cloud
1. Every application or system should have a release checklist or an [agile release train](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/agile-release-train/) process defined. Read about our [release management practice and responsabilities](https://cds-snc.github.io/guide-product-teams-equipes-produits/release-management-responsibilities/)
1. Keep a [release manifest file](https://dzone.com/articles/release-snapshots-smart) that links releases and component versions. Here is one [example](https://github.com/cds-snc/c19-benefits-manifest/blob/master/manifest.json) 
1. Automate your release notes
1. Provide a rollback plan for each release
1. Leverage a [green/blue deployment](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html)
1. If possible, use techniques to throttle traffic to the new release e.g. [canary release](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html)
1. Ensure each release candidate is properly tested (manually or automatically).  Testing should cover: unit tests, integration tests and performance tests
1. Ensure each release candidate has gone through a vulnerability scan
1. Always verify/monitor production logs and key metrics right after a release
1. Avoid deploying outside business hours or just before the weekend or bank holidays
