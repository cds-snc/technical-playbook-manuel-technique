title: Security first 
---

Our digital services have to protect sensitive information and keep systems secure. This is typically a process of continuous review and improvement which should be built into the development and maintenance of the service. A key process to building a secure service is comprehensively testing and certifying the components in each layer of the technology stack for security vulnerabilities, and then to re-use these same pre-certified components for multiple services.

### Skills to work on

1. Seek what security means for your organization and your application and prioritize it sooner in your product development
1. Use a static code analysis tool to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs
1. Use a secret scan (e.g. Git Seekret) to prevent adding sensitive information into a code repository
1. Enable code dependency scanning and automatic patching e.g. Snyk
1. Publish [vulnerability disclosure policies](https://github.com/cds-snc/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
1. Enable Docker container image vulnerability scanning
1. Do a Risk/Threat Analysis consistently across products
1. Use shared secret management
