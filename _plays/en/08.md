title: Develop accessible front-end 
---

Building accessible services means meeting the needs of as many people as possible. From the start, we work with the people who will use a product, including people with disabilities.

<h3>Skills to work on </h3>

1. Ensure every UI component is accessible; refer to our guide https://digital.canada.ca/a11y/ 
1. Perform automated accessibility scans during end to end automated tests using [axe-core integration with Cypress](https://www.deque.com/blog/how-to-test-for-accessibility-with-cypress/)
