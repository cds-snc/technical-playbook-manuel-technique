title: Get production support right
---

The world depends on “always on” services more than ever before. An outage can affect millions of people, with real impact: they can’t pay their bills, they can’t book their flights, they can’t video call with their friends. And whether you’re having a major bug, capacity issues, or you’re down completely, customers who depend on your services expect an immediate response. (The same is true for internal teams.)

A fair on-call schedule, coupled with an on-call compensation plan, can even foster a culture of shared responsibility and help your teams learn more about what it takes to make resilient software and services, making for a better overall product and fewer outages.

<h3>Skills to work on </h3>

1. Clearly define the on-call responsibilities, provide on-call training and access to all needed tools
1. Implement a rich knowledge base and document every incident 
1. Check-in regularly if the process is healthy and effective 
1. Build an effective on-call schedule. Use the right tool; we use OpsGenie
1. Every product team member should be part of the on-call schedule either as an incident commander or an on-call developer
