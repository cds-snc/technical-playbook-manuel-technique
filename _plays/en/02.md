title: Continuously integrate
---

The greatest and most wide ranging benefit of continuous integration is reduced risk. It allows you to detect issues sooner. It is a fail-fast mechanism and removes one of the biggest barriers to frequent deployment.

### Skills to work on
1. Integrate changes into a mainline as early as possible 
1. Define your peer review process and documentation. Start with a [pull request template](https://github.com/cds-snc/.github/blob/master/pull_request_template.md)
1. Use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) to version your changes
1. Enforce [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). See [why](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#why-use-conventional-commits)
