title: Work in the open
---

When we collaborate in the open and publish our data publicly, we can improve Government together. By building services more openly and publishing open data, we simplify the publicâ€™s access to government services and information, allow the public to contribute easily, and enable reuse by entrepreneurs, nonprofits, other agencies, and the public.

<h3>Skills to work on </h3>

2. Leverage [Github](https://www.github.com/) to publish code, track issues, and share the product backlog
3. For each code repository, publish a simple and clear [code of conduct](https://github.com/cds-snc/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/cds-snc/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), [license](https://github.com/cds-snc/.github/blob/master/LICENSE), and [security vulnerability disclosure process](https://github.com/cds-snc/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
